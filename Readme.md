# Requirements

This solutions are implemented in python 2.7 with the following libraries

numpy, IPython, bfc(in this repo.)

...> sudo apt-get instal numpy ipython

# Some minor changes

hw2.py cant open class Binomial. so i added import line for this class.
Also, onePeriodPrice is not recognized well in hw2.py and in bfc/binomial.py, i declared explicitly in those files.
